# v3.0.0

This is a massive release. A _mostly_ complete rewrite in ES6. What started out as a few changes quickly snowballed. There's many breaking changes so be careful upgrading.

### Big changes

-   New settings menu complete with funky animations
-   Ability to adjust speed of playback
-   Ability to toggle caption language (HTML5 and Vimeo only)
-   Ability to set YouTube quality (HTML5 will follow)
-   Added support for Vimeo captions
-   Added Picture-in-Picture support (Safari only)
-   Added AirPlay support (again, Safari only)
-   Added `playsinline` support for iOS 10+
-   Soundcloud removed until I can work on a plugin framework
-   Embedded players are now progressively enhanced - no more empty `<div>`s!

### Other stuff

-   Now using SASS exclusively. Sorry, LESS folk it just made sense to maintain one method as SASS is what the cool kids use. It may come back if we work out an automated way to convert the SASS
-   Moved to ES6. All the rage these days. You'll need to look at polyfills. The demo uses [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io)
-   Added basic looping support
-   Added an aspect ratio option for those that can't leave the 90s and want 4:3
-   `controlshidden` and `controlsshown` events added for when the controls show or hide
-   `qualityrequested` and `qualitychange` events for YouTube quality control (HTML5 will follow)
-   Volume is now `0` to `1` as per HTML5 spec
-   No longer bodging a `<progress>` behind the `<input type="range">` to make up for WebKit's lack of lower fill styling
-   Captions now render with line breaks as intended
-   Captions now render without AJAX using the native events etc
-   Added a fallback for getting YouTube video data incase `.getVideoData()` disappears when one of their developers randomly deletes it again
-   Setup and building of the UI should be way "snappier"
-   Click to toggle inverted time (e.g. 0:01 or -2:59 for a 3 minute video at 1 seconds) - new `toggleInvert` and `invertTime` options
-   Added `autopause` option for Vimeo
-   Added `muted` option for you guessed it, muted playback
-   Restored the `.off()` API method
-   `.play()` will now return a promise to prevent that pesky uncaught promise issue in Chrome etc
-   Pressing and hold the seek bar no longer freezes all other updates of the UI

...plus loads of bug fixes.

### Breaking changes

You gotta break eggs to make an omelette. Sadly, there's quite a few breaking changes:

-   Setup now uses proper constructor, accepts a single selector/element/node and returns a single instance - much simpler than before
-   Much of the API is now using getters and setters rather than methods (where it makes sense) to match the HTML5 API - see the docs for more info
-   The data attributes for the embeds are now `data-plyr-provider` and `data-plyr-embed-id` to prevent compatibility issues. These can be changed under `config.attributes.embed` if required
-   `blankUrl` -> `blankVideo`
-   `volume` is now `0` to `1` as per HTML5 spec
-   `keyboardShorcuts` (typo) is now just `keyboard`
-   `loop` is now `loop.active` in preparation for loop enhancements later
-   `html` option for custom controls removed in favour of the `controls` option which now accepts an array (to use built in controls) or a string of HTML for custom controls.
-   `classes` -> `classNames`
-   `classes.videoWrapper` -> `classNames.video`
-   `classes.embedWrapper` -> `classNames.embed`
-   `classes.ready` removed
-   `classes.setup` removed
-   `classes.muted` removed
-   `classes.fullscreen.active` removed in favour of the `:fullscreen` selector
-   `selectors.html5` removed
-   `selectors.embed` removed
-   `selectors.buttons.seek` -> `selectors.inputs.seek`
-   `selectors.volume.input` -> `selectors.inputs.volume`
-   `selectors.volume.display` -> `selectors.display.volume`
-   `selectors.currentTime` -> `selectors.display.currentTime`
-   `selectors.duration` -> `selectors.display.duration`

### Polyfilling

Because we're using the fancy new ES6 syntax, you will need to polyfill for vintage browsers if you want to use Plyr and still support them. Luckily there's a decent service for this that makes it painless, [polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io). Alternatively, you can use the prebuilt polyfilled build but bear in mind this is 20kb larger. I'd suggest working our your own polyfill strategy.

# v2.0.0

This version contains several potential **_breaking changes_**:

-   `setup()` has been reverted to pre v1.8.0 behaviour; meaning it will return the _instance_ rather than the _element_. This is because the reference to the instance is no longer added to the original element (see below).
-   The reference to the `plyr` instance is now added to the media element rather than original container. This is because if a container with multiple children was passed to `setup()` the references to all instances would have been added to the container, creating issues. I would recommend using the return value from `setup()` or the new `get()` method to access the instance.
-   Players will always be wrapped in their own div now - this makes `setup()` and `destroy()` cleaner. This _may_ break any custom styling based on DOM position.
-   Players no longer seek to 0 on 'ended' - this is to fix a bug with Microsoft Edge as it triggers 'ended' on media change for whatever reason. They'll never change ;-)

And some other changes and bug fixes:

-   New `get()` method on the global plyr object to get all instances inside a container
-   New API methods: - `getOriginal()` to get the original, _unmodified_ element plyr was setup on (`<video>`, `<audio>` or empty `<div>` for YouTube and Vimeo) - `getContainer()` to get the players outer wrapper element - `getMedia()` to get the players media element (`<video>`, `<audio>` or empty `<div>` for YouTube and Vimeo) - `getEmbed()` to access the YouTube or Vimeo API directly - `getType()` to get the type of the player - `isReady()` to determine if an instance has completed setup and necessary APIs are loaded (for YouTube / Vimeo) - `on()` to provide an easy way to listen to events - `stop()` to, you guessed it, stop the player
-   `destroy()` now works correctly for YouTube and Vimeo (fixes #272)
-   New `destroyed` event when `destroy()` has completed (original element is passed as event.target)
-   Default volume is now 10 (max) rather than 5
-   Sprite is only loaded once (fixes #259)
-   Fixes for Vimeo post message bugs on source change or destroy (fixes #318)
-   Save caption state in storage (fixes #311)
-   Added keyboard shortcuts to the current focused player (with `keyboardShortcuts` boolean option to disable) (fixes #309)
-   Fix for captions bug (fixes #332)
-   Change to AMD (fixes #298)

### v1.8.12

-   Vimeo keyboard focus fix (Fixes #317)
-   Fix for Vimeo on basic support devices

### v1.8.2

-   Fixed event bubbling

### v1.8.1

-   Fixed inaccurate log message

## v1.8.0

-   **_(Important)_** `setup()` now returns the element Plyr was setup on rather than the `plyr` object. This means `var player = plyr.setup()[0];` would now be `var player = plyr.setup()[0].plyr;`. This improves support for React and other virtual dom frameworks as mentioned in #254
-   Fixed using a relative URL for `iconUrl` in IE (fixes #269)

## v1.7.0

-   SASS cleanup (fixes #265)
-   Docs tidy up to help quick start (fixes #253)
-   Fix for issues with data attribute options passing (fixes #257)
-   **_(Important)_** Removed the requirement for a wrapper div to setup Plyr and removed the dependency on the `plyr` classname as a JS hook. By default it will now look for `<video>`, `<audio>` and `[data-type]` elements. If you are just calling `setup()` with a `<div class="plyr">` you may want to give it a good test after upgrading. You can probably remove the wrapper div. The reason behind this is to make setup easier for newcomers and prevent the styling being used on unsupported players (because the plyr classname was used as a CSS and JS hook - which isn't ideal)
-   Renamed the 'docs' folder to `demo` to avoid confusion - the readme is the docs after all

### v1.6.19

### v1.6.1

-   Tooltip changes for accessibility

## v1.6.0

-   New, cleaner, UI: - Controls are now overlaid, maintaining the video's ratio and making sizing easier - A large play button can now be overlaid over videos - Default number of control buttons reduced - New play, pause, rewind and fast forward icons - Flexbox all the things!
-   Tidied up the LESS (and SCSS) as part of the above, variables and mixins in seprate files amking customization and upgrades easier
-   Toggle mute bug fix; if a player was muted previously and the user refreshed, unmuting would have meant volume was still zero (effectively muted), now the config default value is used. Not ideal but good for now
-   New `iconUrl` option allowing specifying a same origin SVG sprite location. Loading this way means you don't need the AJAX sprite loading JavaScript
-   `click` option renamed to `clickToPlay` to make it a bit more self explanatory. Unfortunately cross origin SVG sprites is not supported in any browser yet :-(
-   `hideControls` is now a global option, rather than being exclusive to fullscreen. Controls are now hidden after 2 seconds of no mouse movement. Controls are always shown when media is paused or stopped. This is defaulted to true.
